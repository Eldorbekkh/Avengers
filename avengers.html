        <td>Thor Odinson is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
            character is based on the Norse mythological god of the same name, the Asgardian god of thunder whose

            founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, Thor has a host of supporting characters and enemies.

            1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the character founded the

        <td>Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
            cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics (cover dated
            March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic
            supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character
            during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war, and the Captain America
            comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the
            character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.
